### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ananya Kulshrestha, a junior at MIT majoring in Computer Science / AI (Feel free to reach out at ananya_k@mit.edu)

## Experiences:
Research (Collaborative Learning and Autonomy Research Lab) September 2024 - Present

â€¢ Developing and implementing learning algorithms for teaching robots complex features such as fragility and flexibility using multimodal feedback, including demonstrations, comparisons, and natural language inputs.

Cloud Software Intern - Robotics Platform (NVIDIA Corporation) May 2024 - August 2024

â€¢ Streamlined GPU workflow scheduling by integrating AWS's mountpoint-s3, optimizing time and space efficiency for Robotics and ML workflows.

â€¢ Achieved superior performance benchmarks by enabling on-demand data access, facilitating faster debugging and result procurement, with read speeds comparable to traditional download methods.

Skin Cancer Detection Project

â€¢ Developed an ensemble of CNNs (ResNet, AlexNet, VGG, DenseNet) that enhanced skin cancer detection accuracy, outperforming individual models in key metrics (https://github.com/ananyakul/skin-cancer-detection).

RL Policy Ensemble for Stock Trading Project

â€¢ Created a robust stock trading strategy by integrating multiple RL models (DQN, DDPG, A2C, PPO) into an ensemble, leading to improved performance in volatile markets (https://github.com/ananyakul/rl-stock-prediction). 

Research (Robotics Embodied Intelligence Experiment Creation Pipeline Developer) January 2024 - March 2024

â€¢ Helped the development of advanced object variability features within the EI Quest Robotics codebase, enhancing the robotic simulation environment to mimic real-world scenarios,  contributing to the advancement of robotics/AI research.

Research with Speech Communication Group at MIT  June 2023 - August 2023

â€¢ Worked on a project focused on expanding speech recognition to other accents, dialects, speech disabilities, etc using prediction algorithms developed from machine learning techniques (i.e. Gaussian Models)

â€¢ Learned about acoustic cues/IPA and labeled various audio files with the correct acoustic cues using scripts and linguistics knowledge

Iterating the RSK (Robinson-Schensted-Knuth) Bijection (10.2140/involve.2021.14-3 / arXiv:2103.04707) June 2020 - July 2021

â€¢ Published a paper which Investigates the dynamics of the RSK bijection and explores variations in reading words and cycles

â€¢ Proved different theorems for the paper, used Python code to generate large amounts of data in order to substantiate conjectures


## Awards and Recognition:
Neo Scholar Finalist, Feb 2024

Y Combinator Startup Challenge Winner, September 2023

â€¢ Selected in the top 6 teams at HackMIT for the best startup idea and invited to exclusive dinner with Y Combinator team members
